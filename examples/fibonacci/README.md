# SP1 Project Template

This is a template for creating an end-to-end [SP1](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1) project
that can generate a proof of any RISC-V program.

## Requirements

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
- [SP1](https://docs.succinct.xyz/docs/sp1/getting-started/install)

## Running the Project

There are 3 main ways to run this project: execute a program, generate a core proof, and
generate an EVM-compatible proof.

### Build the Program

The program is automatically built through `script/build.rs` when the script is built.

### Execute the Program

To run the program without generating a proof:

```sh
cd script
cargo run --release -- --execute
```

This will execute the program and display the output.

### Generate an SP1 Core Proof

To generate an SP1 [core proof](https://docs.succinct.xyz/docs/sp1/generating-proofs/proof-types#core-default) for your program:

```sh
cd script
 RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo run --release -- --prove --output-file ../../proofs/fibonacci_proof.bin
 ```
